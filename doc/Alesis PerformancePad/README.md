# Alesis PerformancePad controller script for Bitwig

Provides following features, all configurable in the controller preferences window: 
* **Custom gate time** (5-100ms)   
  The PerformancePad is sending NoteOn-NoteOff messages too close to another per hit, 
   so they weren't reliably triggering sounds in Bitwig (at least on my machine). That's why the script will generate its own note-off messages.
* **Velocity curves**: 
  * Linear (as received from the device)
  * ADD-xx (increased by an offset)
  * FIX-xx (fix velocity values)
  * GAMMA-x (non-linear increase, from soft GAMMA-2 to strong GAMMA-4)  
    [Here is a graph of the curves][gammaGraph].
* **Translate pads to notes C1..G1** (as expected by Bitwig's DrumMachine, D16's Drumazon, Microtonic etc),  
  or use the notes as generated by the device.
