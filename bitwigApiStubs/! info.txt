For better code completion (in IntelliJ), this folder is filled on project start with the Bitwig API stuff
by calling the grunt default task in the project root folder:

$ grunt

Bitwig's API .js files (stubs and helpers) will be copied from the Bitwig installation folder
which is determined automatically (currently tested on Windows only).
If paths need adjustments for your machine, see /Gruntfile.js.
