This directory contains slightly modified copies of the Bitwig's API .js files (stubs and helpers)
taken from the Bitwig installation directory.

All fully qualified (Java) class names are stripped down to pure class names,
i.e. the `com.bitwig.extension...` package part removed, for easier code completion in Webstorm.

Auto-update these files via:

$ grunt updateApiStubs

(Update requires Bitwig installation on this machine. Tested on Windows, adjust paths in Grunfile.js for other OS)
