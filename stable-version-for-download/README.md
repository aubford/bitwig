## Stable version download
#### How to install:

1.  Download the latest ZIP file (click the file, then **View Raw** -> the download dialog should appear)
2.  Unpack that ZIP file to your Bitwig Controller Scripts folder:
    *   **Windows: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Bitwig Studio\Controller Scripts**
    *   **Linux/Mac: ~/Documents/Bitwig Studio/Controller Scripts**
       
    *(After that, a folder called "**LeP's Controller Scripts**" should exist in the Controller Scripts folder)*
3.  Open the **Preferences** dialog in Bitwig and go to **Controllers**
3.  Best, **add the controller manually** instead of Autodetect (since multiple scripts may exist for the same controller and Autodetect might load them all)
5.  Done.
